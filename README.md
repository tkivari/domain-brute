domain-brute
============

A brute force domain name availability checker.  Requires Siesta REST client from https://www.github.com/tkivari/Siesta

Although this library works well, Namecheap's API has a very low request limit before throttling requests.

This library is an example of how to integrate the Siesta REST client into an application.
